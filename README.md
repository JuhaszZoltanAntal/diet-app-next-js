This is a diet app to manage your daily meals, generate and customize your weekly diet.

Stack which I use: next.js, mongodb atlas, next auth (google cloud platform), react context API, jest

To run the project locally run:

npm install 

add a .env file in the root folder with the content like:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID={your google cloud app client id}
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET={your google cloud app client secret}

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

JWT_SECRET={jwt generated by vercel (you can ganarete one in the command line: "openssl rand -base64 32")}
```
